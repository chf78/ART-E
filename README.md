Main firmware, adapted from Makeblock Firmware_for_MegaPi: [ART-E Firmware](https://github.com/chf78/ART-E/tree/main/ART-E%20Firmware)

Code files from various stages in the early development process: [ART-E Testing Software](https://github.com/chf78/ART-E/tree/main/ART-E%20Testing%20Software)

Code used in testing of all non-Makeblock sensors (color sensors, LCD display): [Sensor Testing Software](https://github.com/chf78/ART-E/tree/main/Sensor%20Testing)

Code used to test mini servo motors (not used in final prototype): [Servo Testing Software](https://github.com/chf78/ART-E/tree/main/Servo%20Motors)
